# stack-data-structure
 
This repository contains two implementations of a stack data structure in C++ using arrays: one that follows a procedural programming paradigm, and another that follows an object-oriented programming paradigm. The code is written in standard C++ and can be compiled using any modern C++ compiler.

The procedural implementation is contained in the stack_procedural.cpp file. This implementation provides functions to create a stack, push an element onto the stack, pop an element from the stack, and check whether the stack is empty or not. The stack is implemented as a simple array of fixed size.

The object-oriented implementation is contained in the stack_oop.cpp file. This implementation defines a Stack class with private member variables for the array that stores the stack elements and the size of the stack. The class provides public member functions to create a stack, push an element onto the stack, pop an element from the stack, and check whether the stack is empty or not.

Both implementations are thoroughly commented and include sample usage code in the main.cpp file. The sample code demonstrates how to create a stack, push and pop elements onto and off of the stack, and check whether the stack is empty or not.

The code in this repository is free to use and modify under the MIT license.

Usage:
 To use the code in this repository, simply clone or download the repository and compile the source files using a C++ compiler. The compiled program can then be run to test the stack data structure implementations.
